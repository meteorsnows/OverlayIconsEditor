# OverlayIconsEditor
A small and simple tool to easily change the priority of the overlay icon handlers in Windows Explorer

**WARNING**: This program performs changes to the Windows Registry. Use it at your own risk!

Programs such as DropBox, OneDrive and TortoiseSVN, among many others, provide user feedback about a file status through icons overlays.
These overlays appear as small indicators over the files' default icons, indicating different states, such as if the file has been synchronized, backed up, updated or perhaps, to indicate that some error has occurred in whatever process the program responsible for the overlays is responsible for.

Because Windows has a limit on the number of handlers that are used to display such overlays, this tool can be useful to define your own priorities and elevate or downgrade certain handlers based on your preferences.
